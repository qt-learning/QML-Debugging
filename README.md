# QML-Debugging

This is the repo for the QML Debugging Course on Qt Academy.

## Getting Started

- In this repo, you will find an example project that will be used throughout the course to demonstrate debugging techniques in QML.

## Instructions

To get started with this project, you will need to have Qt and Qt Creator installed on your computer. You can download Qt and Qt Creator from the [Qt.io website](qt.io).

Once you have Qt and an Qt Creator installed, head over to [Qt Academy](academy.qt.io) and follow along to create the project template and add the assets to the project.

To run the project, navigate to the folder in Qt Creator and open the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Build and run the project in Qt Creator. The application will launch and you will see the application at that current stage.
